                            The real estate market in Pereira has experienced significant growth, becoming an important driver of the regional economy. The high demand for properties for sale, rent, and new projects has fueled remarkable development in this coffee-producing city. A key factor has been the 40% increase in public investment by the city government, which has enhanced infrastructure and the city's appeal. As a result, the price per square meter has reached between 6 and 9 million pesos, positioning Pereira as one of Colombia's most competitive cities in the real estate sector.

                            This growth has benefited developers and buyers but has also posed challenges for individual property managers. An illustrative case is that of a manager handling 17 houses with 30 tenants. Until now, their workflow has been entirely manual, gathering and storing key information such as tenant names, property owners, contacts, and contracts using only pen and paper. While this approach was functional in the past, the growing volume of information has revealed serious limitations.

                        <p className='text'>
                            The main issues include lost contracts, errors in payment and deadline reminders, and the vulnerability of data to external factors like physical deterioration. These challenges complicate daily management and increase the risk of conflicts with tenants and property owners, undermining efficiency and trust in administrative processes.
                        </p>
                        <p className='text'>
                            In light of this situation, the need arises for a digital tool that is simple, accessible, and tailored to individuals managing properties without the infrastructure of a real estate agency. Although the market offers over 100 real estate apps, according to SimilarWeb, they mostly focus on property visibility, as seen in platforms like FincaRa√≠z and Metrocuadrado. However, few provide practical solutions for administrative property management.

                        <p className='text'>
                            The growth of Pereira's real estate sector presents an opportunity to develop technological tools tailored to the needs of individual property managers. A platform that enables contract storage, automatic reminders, and secure centralized information management could revolutionize these tasks, enhancing efficiency and reducing errors associated with traditional methods.
